In this Blog I will occasionally write about my experiances developing software during my day-job and hobby projects (im most cases it is probably clear if it was work-related or just for fun :) ).
Most posts are about sharing some specific piece of knowledge or understanding that I gained, e.g. when applying some open source projects in a particular situation, where the official documentation was not detailed enough/ I had to google a lot/ go thorugh trail-and-error to make it work.
